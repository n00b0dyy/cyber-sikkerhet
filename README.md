# cyber-sikkerhet
This repository contains my introductory projects related to cybersecurity and cryptography. As I am still learning. These basic programs include, among other things, scripts for encryption, decryption, and simple vulnerability scanning. They showcase my progress and understanding of fundamental concepts in these fields.


       # Portfolio of Applications related to Cyber Security

Welcome to my programming repository dedicated to cyber security issues. This directory contains mainly files closely related to this key area. Each application has been carefully developed according to the highest standards of code quality and structure.


       # Code Quality and Structure

Code quality and structure are my top priority. Each application in this repo has been written with attention to detail, following the best programming practices. I strive to make the code clear, efficient and easy to maintain.


      #  Documentation and Code Descriptions

Each application includes comprehensive documentation and descriptions, in accordance with the principles of correct code spelling. I pay special attention to ensure that each function is described in a clear and understandable manner. Documentation makes it easier to understand the operation of the code and possible modifications.


       # Summary

All the applications included in this portfolio are the result of my passion for programming and interest in the field of cyber security. I hope you will find here valuable tools and inspiration for further development in this fascinating field.

Thank you for your interest in my repo!
