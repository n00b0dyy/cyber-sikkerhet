"""
This Python script is designed to fetch a list of the most frequently occurring words from a specified webpage and save these words to a CSV file. The script uses the requests library to retrieve the webpage content, BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML, and the csv library to save the data into a CSV file. This automation helps in extracting textual data from the internet for subsequent analysis. In google excel sheets you can use syntax =GOOGLETRANSLATE(text, [source_language, target_language]) and then drag to the bottom, so all database will be translated to choosen language.
